Ubuntu Font Family source code

  *  *.vfb design files are used with FontLab Studio 5.
  *  VTT/*.ttf files are inputs to MS Visual TrueType (Hinting)
  *  CacheTT/*.cfg file is input to MS CacheTT

Free-as-in-beer programs, to process these files can be found at:

Commercial programs, with a free-as-in-beer limited trial version:

The build process used by Dalton Maag is as follows.  There are no
multiple-masters, any interpolation is done by the designers from the
base font.  Per-font there are currently a total of two source files:

   1. FL: Make adjustments in FontLab
   2. FL: Note list of changed glyphs somewhere (eg. a sheet of paper)
   3. FL: Export as W.ttf
   4. VTT: Load W.ttf into VTT
   5. VTT: Partially import X.ttf (including VTT private "source"
      table), manually deselecting any changed glyphs noted earlier
   6. VTT: Make adjustments in VTT
   7. VTT: Save as X.ttf (including VTT private "source" tables)
   8. VTT: Export as Y.ttf (without VTT private "source" tables)
   9. CacheTT: Process Y.ttf + configuration file with MS CacheTT
      ("optimisation stage")
  10. CacheTT: Distribute optimised Z.ttf as end-user file

This 'Z.ttf' is the version that is then shipped, there is no merging
(other than selective import of glyphs metadata from previous version
in VTT), and no use of VOLT in the current pipeline, although VOLT
will be used for Arabic.  To reproduce the output .ttfs, the following
are required:

   1. one-off .vfb per font (currently four)
   2. one-off .ttf per font (containing VTT "source" tables)
   4. one-off CacheTT .cfg configuration file (across all fonts)
   3. one-off .ttf per font (final output)
