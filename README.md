## Overview

### The challenge

Experience seamless sign-up with the Multi-Step Form Component! 

This webpage features a multi-step form for signing up for a package, allowing users to complete each step of the sequence, go back to a previous step to update their selections, and see a summary of their selections on the final step before confirming their order. 

Users can:-
- View the optimal layout for the interface based on their device's screen size 
- Interact with hover states and focus states for all interactive elements. 
- The form includes form validation messages to ensure that users provide accurate information and make selections for each step.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

Through this project I got to learn about CSS focus functionality to better animate website when user visits it and focuses on a certain section of it or a certain element of it as shown below for an input field-

```css
form input {
	height: 2rem;
	border-radius: 5px;
	border: 0.5px gray solid;
	margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
	padding: 0.2rem 0.5rem;
}

textarea:focus,
input:focus {
	outline: none;
}
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
